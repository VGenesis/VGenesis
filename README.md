Hi, I'm VGenesis, a 4th year computer architecture and software engineering student. 

I started my programming journey in 2012 in QBASIC and then expanded my reach on various low and high level languages as well as hardware design.

General purpose programming:
* x86 Assembly
* C/C++
* Java
* Rust

Web Development:
* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* JS, React, AJAX
* PHP, Spring Boot

Embedded systems:
* Arduino

Game Development:
* GameMaker
* Godot
* Java

Hardware Design Tools:
* Logisim
* Verilog/SystemVerilog

Organizational/optional tools:
* Git
* Vim

Currently on the lookout for jobs while I'm finishing school. Part-time work would be ideal.
Thank you for reading, and have a nice day!
