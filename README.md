Hi, I'm VGenesis, a 2nd year software engineering student. 

I started my programming journey in 2012 in QBASIC and then expanded my reach on various low and high level languages over nearly 10 years.
I am currently active in Java and Godot. Other languages I've worked in include Assembly, C, C++, Python, Game Maker and a bit of Unity.

I have no current experience in IT jobs, so I guess I will be posting my projects here until a recruiter notices.

Thanks for reading, and have a nice day!
