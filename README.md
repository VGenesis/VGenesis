Hi, I'm VGenesis,

I am a 2nd year software engineering student. 
I started programming in 2011 in QBASIC and then expanded my reach on various low and high level languages.
I am currently active in Java and Godot. Other languages I've worked in include Assembly, C, C++, Python, Game Maker and a bit of Unity.
Right now you could say I have been programming for 10 years.

I have no current experience in IT jobs, so I guess I will be posting my projects here until a recruiter notices.

Thanks for reading, and have a nice day!
